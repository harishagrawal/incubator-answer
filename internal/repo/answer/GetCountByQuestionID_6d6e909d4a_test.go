Test generated by RoostGPT for test go-unit using AI Type Azure Open AI and AI Model roostgpt-4-32k

1. Check if the function returns the accurate count for a provided valid question ID.
2. Check if the function returns 0 when provided with a question ID that has no associated answers.
3. Check how the function responds when provided with a question ID that doesn't exist in the database.
4. Validate the function's behavior when the question ID is NULL.
5. Validate the function to see what it returns when the database doesn't have any records at all.
6. Test to see how the function behaves under the condition where some answers have a status different from "Available". They should not be included in the count.
7. Test the function when there are multiple answers associated with a single question ID. It should count all of them accurately.
8. Validate the function's behavior when it experiences a database error. It should return an error accordingly.
9. Test the function's response when the context is canceled; it should handle this smoothly and possibly return a context canceled error.
10. Check the function's performance with a large number of records in the database to ensure it can handle the load.
11. Test the function's behavior when the input question ID is in the DeShortID format. It should be handled correctly and the count should be returned accurately.
12. Validate how the function behaves if the question ID is not valid or in an incorrect format.
13. Check if the function returns an error when the database connection is not available or disconnected.
14. Test the function's response when the database query takes longer to execute; it should handle the timeout scenario appropriately.
